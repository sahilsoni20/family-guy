# Family Guy - Next.Js FullStack web app

## ⚙️Technology Used 
- Next JS
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## 💡What I Learn ?
I started this repository for learning purposes. I have learned about what Next.js is, its file structure, and the different routing systems like API routing and UI routing. I have also become familiar with Server-side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and dynamic routing.

### About this Project 
You can start by creating the file structure, which is the most important part of a Next.js project. After understanding the file structure, you can begin by making component files like `Navigation` and `Container`. We will use the Container component throughout the UI routing.

The API folder is crucial for API routing. Square brackets in folder names denote dynamic routing. We store all our data in the Data folder. For a better understanding of API routing, you can check the routes as you create them (refer to `Request.rest` inside the utils folder).

## ⚒️Features

- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- API routes for handling server-side logic
